## App Description

### Your Log Your Way

Liftris is a feature-rich workout logging app focused on letting you log the way you want to.

Liftris supports features like custom app themes, slider and increment weights, half reps, and deep insights easily accessible without having to dig through menus.

Designed to be a blank canvas, Liftris lets you log the way you want without worrying about formatting.

## Website Technical Details

The Liftris website is made with React, using NextJS for static site generation, and is hosted on Netlify.

The design and layout of the site is all custom components and I use TailwindCSS for easier styling.
